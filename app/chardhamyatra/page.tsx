                the majestic Kedarnath range. Kedar is another name for Lord
                Shiva, the protector, and destroyer. According to legend, the
                Pandavas, after having won over the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra
                war, felt guilty for having killed their own brothers and sought

                them, and while fleeing, took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of
                a bull. Upon being followed, he dived into the ground, leaving
                his hump on the surface. The remaining portions of Lord Shiva
                appeared at four other places and are worshipped there as his

                Joshimath is situated on the slopes above the confluence of the
                rivers Alaknanda and Dhauliganga. Of the four 'Maths'
                established by Adi Shankaracharya, Joshimath is the winter seat
                of Badrinath. The idol is brought down to Joshimath and
                installed in the temple for people to worship. There are many
                other temples in the township. The most important is the temple
                of Nir Singh with the idol of Lord Vishnu. The left arm of this
                deity is getting destroyed with time, and the popular belief
                holds that the day the arm completely withers, Badrinath valley
                will cease to exist, and the Gods will transfer the residence
                into the neighboring Niti Valley at Bhavishya Badri.
